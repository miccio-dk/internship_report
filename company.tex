\section{Company description}
UAVComponents ApS is a danish company which develops and supplies components, equipment, and tools for drones and UAVs integrators and hobbyists.
Its main products are the TSLRS line of transceivers and the Aeronav One ground control station.
Along with off-the-shelf hardware solutions, the company offers its expertise to clients seeking consultancy or ad-hoc projects.
UAVComponents shares its offices and personnel with Danish Aviation Systems, a sister company also operating in the drones industry.

The team is composed of roughly 8 people, almost all of whom are involved in Research and Development.
Besides a solid know-how of piloted and autonomous aerial vehicles, the core competencies include the electronic design of analogic and MCU-based solutions, and software development --- both for embedded and computer systems.
The company relies on external support for more skill-intensive tasks such as mechanical and RF design.
Manufacture is also mostly outsourced, especially for high volume yields.

As the vast majority of the employees is quite young, the company can boast a very dynamic and informal atmosphere, which in turn resulted in flexible working hours and a high degree of collaboration among all the colleagues.
