\section{Company description}
UAVComponents ApS is a danish company which develops and supplies components, equipment, and tools for drones and UAVs integrators and hobbists.
Its main products are the TSLRS line of transciever and the Aeronav One ground control station.
The company shares its offices and personnel with Danish Aviation Systems, a sister company also operating in the drones industry. 

The team is composed of roughly 8 people, almost all of whom are involved in Research&Development. 
Besides a solid know-how of piloted and autonomous aerial veicles, the core competencies include electronic design of analogic and MCU-based solutions, and software development - both for embedded and computer systems. 
The company relies on external support for more skill-instensive tasks - such as mechanical and RF design. 
Manufacture is also mostly outsourced, especially for high volume yields.

As the vast majority of the employees is quite young, the company can boast a very dynamic and informal atmosphere, which in turn resulted in flexible working hours and a high degree of collaboration among all the colleagues.
