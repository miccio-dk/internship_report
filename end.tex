\section{Conclusions}
Working for UAVComponents revealed to be a unique experience.
Dealing with large projects and collaborating with people with different technical backgrounds has taught me how to have a structured mindset: keeping a detailed log of the source code revision and setting up a proper project structure from the beginning is in fact fundamental when trying improve productivity.

The environment of a small firm allowed me to explore many fields, making the work seem more varied and less monotonous.
I particularly enjoyed the friendly and relaxed atmosphere and perceived lack of vertical management.

Nevertheless, being part of a small team implies sharing a larger deal of responsibilities and committing to more odd tasks.
In fact, several times it has been needed to come to work despite late hours, weekends, and holidays for the sake of fulfilling a deadline.

As a self-assessment of the job performance, the company has offered me a part-time position with the possibility of developing a final project, and has shown vivid interest in continuing the collaboration after the end of the education.

To conclude, it has been a very exciting and challenging chance to develop my engineering skills and contribute to a fresh and thriving market.
