\begin{abstract}
This document discusses and analyzes the work done at UAVComponents ApS from June 2015 to January 2016, as part of the mandatory internship required for acquiring a B.Eng. in Electronics and Computer Engineering at DTU.
The internship has been carried out on a full-time basis at the main headquarter of the company, and was allocated 30 ECTS points as per study plan.

The content of this document is divided using the following scheme: an introduction to the company and its activities, a description of the role I have been assigned along with its tasks and duties, an overview of the relevant knowledge acquired during previous courses at DTU, and the relevant tools and instruments used.
Conclusions will be drawn, based on the overall experience in the company and the newly gained experience and skills.
